# artifacts_learning_mridata

for artifacts_learning-dwt.py-----

The python file converts the 3d mri data in nifty format(.nii) of undersampled and fully sampled data (Oasis brain dataset) to numpy array. 
Then artifacts are generated by substracting under sampled data form fully sampled original data.
Further Approximation and detailed coefficients are extracted using discreete wavelet transformation (Feature extraction method) using 
haar wavelet and these coefficients further passed to two knn regressors (scikit-learn) to train the algorithm and then predicts the coefficients from test data.
Then inverse dwt is applied to predicted results after training model.
other data processing steps include normalization(0-1)
Reuired libraries are nibabel, mumpy, scikit-learn, pywt
